<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Passionate and Aspiring Web Developer, inspired by the ever developing Tech industry, I then changed from a Music Career to a Web Developer Career. 
  This has been such a beautiful and challenging Journey. I look forward to working fulltime as a Web Developer and securing good employment.

<p>I am a married man, living with my spouse. Do not have any children as yet as we want to secure a stable income before bringing new life into the family. My
  wife is my Sanctuary, my most solid Support Structure, and I Love Her Beyond Words. She gives me more and more reaason to wake up every day and work on bettering
  myself.
